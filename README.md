# TEDx-Email-Template

A simple unofficial TEDx html email template that you can use to send email to sponsors, (potential) speakers and attendees.

This is the first html email I have ever worked on, and it turned out rather okay. I am a designer and technician as part of the TEDxParculTineretului team and I could not find any avalible email templates suitable for TEDx events, so I created this one. Enjoy!
